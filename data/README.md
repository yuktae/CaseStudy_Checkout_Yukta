All data is synthetic. Names, addresses, card numbers, BINs, tracking numbers, and merchants are fabricated. Any resemblance to real entities is coincidental.

## cases.json schema

`cases.json` is a JSON array of 10 case objects. Each case has the following shape:

```jsonc
{
  "case_id": "CB-2025-0001",            // unique string identifier
  "scheme": "visa",                      // "visa" | "mastercard"
  "reason_code": "13.1",                 // matches a code in reason_codes.md
  "reason_code_label": "Merchandise / Services Not Received",
  "chargeback_date": "2025-04-18",       // ISO date the chargeback was raised
  "chargeback_amount": {
    "value": 189.99,
    "currency": "GBP"                    // ISO 4217
  },
  "transaction": {
    "transaction_id": "txn_8821AB",
    "merchant_name": "NorthernThread Apparel",
    "merchant_mcc": "5651",              // 4-digit Merchant Category Code
    "transaction_date": "2025-03-22T14:31:08Z",
    "amount": { "value": 189.99, "currency": "GBP" },
    "card_bin_country": "GB",            // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
    "avs_result": "Y",                   // "Y" full match, "N" no match, "A" partial, null if not run
    "cvv_result": "M",                   // "M" match, "N" no match, null if not run
    "three_ds_status": "authenticated",  // "authenticated" | "attempted" | "frictionless" | "not_attempted"
    "ip_address": "82.39.114.22",        // string or null
    "device_fingerprint": "fp_b7d2e9c4a1", // string or null
    "billing_address_postcode": "SW4 7QR",
    "shipping_address_postcode": "SW4 7QR" // may be null for digital goods / services
  },
  "issuer_narrative": "Free-text reason from the issuer...",
  "merchant_evidence_documents": [
    "CB-2025-0001_delivery_confirmation.pdf",
    "CB-2025-0001_carrier_tracking.pdf"
  ]
}
```

Filenames in `merchant_evidence_documents` correspond to files in `documents/`. Mix of PDFs and PNGs.

## reason_codes.md

Contains simplified compelling-evidence requirements for each of the 15 reason codes used in the dataset (9 Visa, 6 Mastercard). For each code, the file lists what a merchant must provide for a defensible representment.

**Important:** these rules are simplified for the take-home. They are not a substitute for real Visa VCR or Mastercard Chargeback Guide documentation.

## Cases at a glance

| # | Case ID | Scheme | Code | Merchant | Spoiler-free hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | CB-2025-0001 | Visa | 13.1 | NorthernThread Apparel | Straightforward - sanity check |
| 2 | CB-2025-0002 | Visa | 13.1 | LumaTech Electronics | Check the addresses carefully |
| 3 | CB-2025-0003 | Mastercard | 4837 | Velo Continental Rentals | How many of the four requirements need to be met? |
| 4 | CB-2025-0004 | Mastercard | 4837 | QuickStream Digital | The merchant's evidence sounds confident |
| 5 | CB-2025-0005 | Visa | 12.6.1 | Roastline Coffee Co | Two charges, same amount, same day |
| 6 | CB-2025-0006 | Visa | 13.3 | HavenHome Furnishings | What can the photo actually tell you? |
| 7 | CB-2025-0007 | Mastercard | 4855 | TerraFreight Logistics | The evidence is in there somewhere |
| 8 | CB-2025-0008 | Visa | 13.2 | FluxFit Online | What's the difference between policy and proof? |
| 9 | CB-2025-0009 | Mastercard | 4859 | Hôtel Marais Saint-Paul | Read the policy and the log together |
| 10 | CB-2025-0010 | Visa | 10.5 | Brightline Beauty | Read the reason code rules carefully |

## Gotchas

A few cases are deliberately tricky. Without spoiling them all, here are two examples to set expectations:

One case has merchant evidence that reads as authoritative and confident - internal scoring, neat tables, a "we are confident this is legitimate" conclusion - but does not actually meet any of the compelling-evidence requirements for the reason code raised. If your tool simply trusts confident-sounding evidence, this is the case it will get wrong. The right answer is `accept_liability`. The interesting bit is how your tool's output makes it easy for the analyst to see that.

One case's compelling evidence is real, but buried inside a multi-page document containing mostly unrelated content. A naive prompt that puts the whole document into context and asks "did the merchant prove delivery?" should work - but might come back uncertain or miss it. A more thoughtful approach (chunking, targeted extraction, citation back to a specific page/line) will do better. We're not requiring any specific approach - but we will read your output and assess whether an analyst could confidently act on it.

Other cases have address mismatches, partial requirement fulfillment, missing 3DS, or reason codes that aren't representable at all. How you surface these to the analyst is what we're evaluating.

## Currency, date, address notes

- Dates are ISO 8601, mostly UTC. Hotel and FR transactions use local context where it matters.
- Amounts are positive numbers; currency is ISO 4217.
- UK postcodes follow standard format; FR postcodes are 5-digit; DE postcodes are 5-digit.
- `avs_result` follows simplified Visa/Mastercard AVS coding: `Y` = full address match, `A` = address match but postcode no, `N` = no match, `null` = not checked.

## Running it

This dataset is framework-agnostic. Load `cases.json` however you like, iterate cases, fetch document content from `documents/` by filename, and feed it to your LLM however suits your design.

If you want a smoke test that everything's wired up:

```
python -c "import json; cases = json.load(open('cases.json')); print(f'{len(cases)} cases loaded'); print(cases[0]['case_id'], cases[0]['reason_code'])"
```

Expected output:

```
10 cases loaded
CB-2025-0001 13.1
```
